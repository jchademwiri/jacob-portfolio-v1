            I am a passionate growing Web Developer and Computer Technician with
            a few skills of working in the information technology and service
            industry. Currently, I am studying Mobile Web Development and Google
            Cloud Computing with Pluralsight. I am a self-motivated hard-working
            individual who can communicate with different people at different
            levels. As a junior Front-End Developer, I would like to increase my
            skills utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Angular and other
            tools to make the best in web development and computer maintenance.
            I have a good understanding of computer servicing and maintenance on
            both hardware and software. I have fallen in love with graphics
            design and I have gained some skills in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe
            Illustrator.

            Do It Yourself (DIY), has been an inbuilt skill which made me want
            to know more on how the computers are built, with that in mind I
            went on to explore mobile phones and computers starting with my own.
